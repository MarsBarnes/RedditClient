#Reddit Basic

##Description
Reddit Basic is a simple app to view subreddits from. This app allows users to view an uncluttered streamlined version of reddit.

##How to run the project
go to website: https://redditbasicbananas.netlify.app/
To run the project, download the files, open a terminal to the directory where your files are stored and run "npm start". This will launch the website.

##How to use the project
Enter a subreddit name into the search bar. Click enter or the search icon to initiate the search. This will change the feed so that you see posts from that subreddit. If you would like to filter these posts, click the filter icon at the top right of the page. There are a few categories you can select from: articles, images, video, text, and nsfw. Only posts that match one of the selected criteria will show on your feed. If you would like to view the comments, you can click the comment button. If you would like to expand the post, you can click on the title of the post and it will open a new tab from reddits website with enlarged media. 

##Limitations and future directions
Currently, this is a read-only view of subreddits. A benefit to this approach is that the user does not have to log in. This also means, the user cannot vote or post at this time. In the future, I would like to add Oauth code to enable secure reddit login. This would then open the door to adding features like posting comments and media.
